# 🧪 Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the deployment workflows without actual deployment infrastructure.

## 🚀 How to Test the Deployment Process

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/react-webpack-demo.git
   git push -u origin main
   git push origin prod
   ```

### **Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
3. Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

### **Step 3: Test DEV/STAG Deployment**

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **"Create Pre-release Tag"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Fill in the inputs:
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Environment**: `dev` or `stag`
   - **Version**: `v1.0.1-dev` or `v1.0.1-stag`
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### **Step 4: Test BETA Deployment**

1. Same as above, but select **Environment**: `beta`
2. Use version like `v1.0.1-beta`

### **Step 5: Test PRODUCTION Deployment**

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit with conventional commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```
3. Push to main branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Wait for release-please to create a PR
5. Merge the PR to trigger production deployment

## 📊 What You'll See

### **DEV/STAG Workflows:**
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Deployment simulation completed
- ✅ Environment-specific notifications

### **BETA Workflows:**
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Infrastructure PR simulation
- ✅ Code-owner approval simulation

### **PRODUCTION Workflows:**
- ✅ Release-please PR creation
- ✅ Automated version bumping
- ✅ Production build simulation
- ✅ Infrastructure PR simulation

## 🔍 Monitoring Workflows

1. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Click on any workflow run
3. Click on the job (e.g., "deploy-dev")
4. Expand steps to see detailed logs

## 📝 Example Workflow Output

```
✅ DEV deployment simulation completed!
Environment: DEV
Tag: v1.0.1-dev
Commit: abc123def456
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **This is a simulation** - no actual deployment happens
- **No external dependencies** - everything runs in GitHub Actions
- **Fast execution** - workflows complete in 2-3 minutes
- **Real deployment** would require actual infrastructure setup

## 🎯 Next Steps for Real Deployment

1. **Set up Kubernetes clusters** for each environment
2. **Configure ArgoCD** for GitOps deployment
3. **Set up notification channels** (Mattermost/Slack)
4. **Configure code owners** for production approvals
5. **Replace echo statements** with actual deployment commands
